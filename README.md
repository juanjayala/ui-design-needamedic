# User Interface Design (Figma) - NeedAMedic
Contributors: Abhigya Chhabra, Archay Dutta, Ching Hui, and Madhurima Dutta.

We followed an iterative process from the initial idea, to research, to the low-fidelity prototype, and to the end product of the high-fidelity prototype. Our application, NeedAMedic, provides an easy and accessible way for users to access healthcare providers for all their medical needs.

## Review Page:
I designed this page on the high-fi prototype.
